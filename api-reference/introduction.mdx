## Welcome

##Introduction
Our API enables seamless communication and data exchange between your application and SearchGPT. By leveraging our API, you can automate the retrieval of SearchGPT data and enhance the functionality of your application.

## Authentication
All API requests must be authenticated using your API key. Include your API key in the request header as follows: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

## Rate Limiting
While in Beta, we are currently limiting requests to 200 per hour. This will be gradually lifted over time.

## Response Times
Because of the nature of searchGPT's text-generation responses may take up to 60 seconds.

## Caching
Results are cached for two hours.

## Error Handling
If an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate error code and message.
